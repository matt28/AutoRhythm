AutoRhythm
==========

A 'tapper' style rhythm game that generates 'tappers' on its own.

This project is still in development... so, it works and it's playable, but the graphics is not really up to standard,
so that's one thing that needs to improve. To compile, you just need to download everything and open it up in Visual C#.
Hit F5 and it should work (in debug). There will be a better graphics update soon, so you might need to include some graphics files and pictures that will be updated in the future.

Derp.
